** in the example, environment are the boxes and the rewards

State
* set of all possible states -> "state space"

Agent
* software
* memory of states, actions, rewards
* does not need to be on the hardware
* uses algorithm to inmprove performance
* all possible actions -> "action space"
** Q Learning wants discrete actions

* First Exercise "Frozen Lake"
